###Web Programming Repository
##Purpose
This repository contains all of the projects I completed for the COMP 20 course at Tufts University, Web Programming, taught by Professor [Ming Chow](http://mchow01.github.io/).
##Favorite Assignment
My favorite assignment was Assignment #3, the server for the Marauder's Map. It was a great introduction to concurrent systems. While making all the different systems work together (the Marauder's Map, the server, express, MongoDb, Heroku, GitHub...) was difficult, it was also rewarding, and really showed the power of using many different tools that each have their own task.
##How I Have Grown
I think the biggest way I've grown is by getting a better understanding of asynchronous programming with JavaScript. It's a completely different paradigm, so I struggled with it and still do struggle with it, but I also have begun to see its power.
##Most Important Thing I Have Learned
I think the most important thing I have learned is the difficulty of truly understanding APIs and higher level languages. The first example of that would be JavaScript, where I often found myself causing errors by using premade functions in ways I wasn't supposed to because I had made assumptions about their functionality or didn't understand the parameters. A second example would be working with the Google APIs for maps and authentication for my final product. With the Google APIs there is a lot going on behind the scenes, and I found it extremely difficult to distinguish between errors I was causing and errors that came from Google's internal processes.
##What I Would Like to Delve Into Further
My interest is in data science, so I would like to look at web based applications that use data. Of particular interest to me is the tradeoffs between analyzing the data on the server side and then serving results, and the other option of serving data and then analyzing client side.
